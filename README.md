Emotions Tracker Web App with API

Welcome to the Emotions Tracker project! This project consists of a web application and an API designed to help users track their mood and emotional well-being.
Web Application

The web application provides users with the ability to:

    Create an account: Users can create a new account to access the Emotions Tracker system.
    Record mood entries: Once signed in, users can record their mood by selecting from a range of 7 emotions, each with an optional contextual trigger.
    View mood history: Users can view their mood history and track changes over time.

For detailed instructions on setting up and using the web application, please refer to the README file located in the web-app folder.
API

    User authentication: Allows users to register new accounts and authenticate existing ones.
    Mood recording: Provides endpoints for recording and retrieving mood entries.
    Data management: Enables users to manage their mood data, such as editing or deleting entries.
