# My EMOTION API Project

## About
This API project serves as the backend for the Emotion Tracking Web Application. It provides endpoints for accessing and manipulating data stored in the SQL database, which is included within the project ZIP file.

## Setup Instructions
1. Extract the project files from the provided ZIP file.
2. Navigate to the extracted project directory.

## Setting Up the Database
1. Ensure that you have a SQL database management tool installed (e.g., MySQL Workbench).
2. Open your SQL database management tool and create a new database with the name `emotion`.
3. Use the SQL scripts provided within the project (located in emotion_api\sql\emotion.sql) to create the necessary tables and populate the database with initial data.

## Installing Dependencies
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install project dependencies: npm install
(Note: The `node_modules` directory and `package-lock.json` file are not included in this repository. You'll need to install dependencies manually.)

## Running the API
1. Start the API server: npm start
2. Once the server is running, you can access the API endpoints using tools like Postman or by integrating them into your web application.
(Note: The API server will be hosted locally at http://localhost:3002).

### Additional Notes
- Ensure Node.js and npm are installed on your system.
